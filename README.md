CREATE A CUSTOM COLOR PALETTE FOR THE WORDPRESS GUTENBERG EDITO

The WordPress Gutenberg block editor allows content creators more design freedom. But it’s not always desirable to give clients access to certain features.

Color palettes are one such area of concern. A client with access to the entire rainbow might inadvertently do more harm than good. Beyond diverging from the carefully-chosen colors, there could also be a negative impact when it comes to accessibility.

Fortunately, WordPress provides a way to limit the colors available within the block editor. This ensures that blocks stay within branding guidelines and might (with a little guidance) help to prevent those undesirable contrast issues.

To take away that rainbow and define your own colors, it requires adding a bit of code to the WordPress theme. Everything will take place in the theme’s functions.php file.
